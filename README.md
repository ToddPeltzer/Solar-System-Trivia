## Unsolved Problems/Issues
I really would have liked to make small space sounds when clicking the correct answer/incorrect answer and possibly at the game start.

I also was wanting to explore the idea of a progression bar across the top of each page to show the user how far they have to go until they reach to end.

Possibly adding in more questions, and expanding into a level based system where the solar system is the first stage, then galaxy, etc.
